Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

    Python 3.x installed
    Basic understanding of Python and Spark
    Familiarity with statistical process control concepts

Installation

    Install PySpark:

    bash

pip install pyspark

(Optional) Install additional libraries if your processing requires:

bash

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

Setting Up the Environment

    Set up your SparkContext and SQLContext:

    python

    from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
    from pyspark.sql import SQLContext

    conf = SparkConf().setAppName("SPC and Dataset Creation")
    sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)
    sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)

Loading Data

    Load your data into a DataFrame:

    python

    df = sqlContext.read.format('com.databricks.spark.csv').options(header='true', inferschema='true').load('path_to_your_data.csv')
    df.show()

Statistical Process Control

    Implement statistical process control methods:
        Example: Calculate and visualize control charts.
        Use PySpark DataFrame operations to calculate mean, standard deviation, etc.
        Plot the results using a library like Matplotlib.

Dataset Creation

    Process data and create new datasets:
        Cleanse data, handle missing values, and perform aggregations.
        Use PySpark SQL or DataFrame API for complex transformations.
        Example code for dataset creation:

        python

        new_df = df.select(...)

Saving Results

    Save your processed data or results:

    python

    new_df.write.format('csv').save('path_to_save_new_dataset.csv')

Examples

Provide a few examples with code snippets demonstrating typical use cases and how your project addresses them.
Additional Resources

List additional resources such as tutorials, documentation, or forums for users to learn more about PySpark and statistical process control.
Contributing

Encourage contributions and provide guidelines on how others can contribute to your project.
